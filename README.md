## üéØ Objectives
* Create a "from scratch" **React** app using NPX
* Learn about **React** components and how they are used to dynamically update the DOM with new information
* Learn how **state** and **props** changes are used
* Learn how to use Swagger to interact with the database using a **REST** API 
* Leverage Netlify and DataStax Astra DB

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è 

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*

> There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * git installed on your local system
> * [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)
>
> You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

- *What other prerequisites are there?*
> * You will need a github account
> * You will also need an Astra DB account, but we'll work through that in the exercises
> * Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*

> Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homework detailed below and you will get a nice badge.

## An introduction to web development
### Demo
- [Step1](https://codepen.io/DatastaxDevs/pen/WNjrXXp)
- [Step2](https://codepen.io/DatastaxDevs/pen/QWvyOOv)
- [Step3](https://codepen.io/DatastaxDevs/pen/mdmVRwy)

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database
**`ASTRADB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

### ‚úÖ Step 1a: Click the button to login or register with Datastax. You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true" />
</details>

**Use the following values when creating the database**
|Field| Value|
|---|---|
|**database name**| `todos_workshop_db` |
|**keypace**| `todos` |
|**Cloud Provider**| *Use the one you like, click a cloud provider logo,  pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region.* |

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/blob/main/tutorial/images/db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 2. Create a security token

‚úÖ  **Step 2a:**  [Create a token for your app](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to use in the settings screen. Use "Database Administrator" permission.

‚úÖ  **Step 2b:**  Copy the token value (eg `AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c....`) in your clipboard and save the CSV, this value would not be provided afterward.

## 3. Create a table with REST API using Swagger

‚úÖ  **Step 3a:** Open **Swagger** by 
1. Click on your active database
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click `REST API`
4. Clik link to your swagger endpoint.

*As shown on the picture below.*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124656913-d28b1b00-de6f-11eb-9712-e7629f5b8867.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 3b:** Navigate to **create a table** section

1. Once **Swagger** is launched, scroll down and navigate to the **schemas** section

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124658644-ffd8c880-de71-11eb-8064-c26a2979b66f.png?raw=true)

2. Then, within the **schemas** section navigate to **Create a table** and click on it to open the section. 
- Take particular note of the REST URI **/api/rest/v2/schemas/keyspaces/{keyspaceName}/tables**. 
- Also take note this is using a **POST** command.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124658990-71187b80-de72-11eb-8d25-01e6c6216aa5.png?raw=true)

3. Click the "Try it out" button

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124659185-ae7d0900-de72-11eb-9108-1595c3306bb3.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 3c:** Create table **restfromreadme_by_id**

1. Enter your **Astra token _(X-Cassandra-Token)_**
2. Enter the **keyspaceName** `todos`

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist/blob/main/images/3c2_create-table.png?raw=true)

3. Finally, copy the create table statement using the code below into the **body** field
```json
{
  "name": "restfromreadme_by_id",
  "ifNotExists": true,
  "columnDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "typeDefinition": "uuid",
      "static": false
    },
    {
      "name": "text",
      "typeDefinition": "text",
      "static": false
    },
    {
      "name": "key",
      "typeDefinition": "text",
      "static": false
    },
        {
          "name": "completed",
          "typeDefinition": "boolean"
        }
  ],
  "primaryKey": {
    "partitionKey": [
      "id"
    ]
  }
}
```

4. And click **execute** to apply the command and create the table

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124660673-84c4e180-de74-11eb-89a9-55dfb017bb8f.png?raw=true)

You should see a **201** response telling you it correctly created the "restfromreadme_by_id" table.

Again, take a note of the Request URL that was used to create the table. This comes into play later when we take a look at the code in `astraRestClient.js` used to create our TODO application table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124663337-f05c7e00-de77-11eb-8daa-856d15f0d223.png?raw=true)


[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 4. Insert data in the Table with the REST API using Swagger
Now that we have a table to use, let's insert a row of data into the table, again using REST to do so.

‚úÖ  **Step 4a:** Navigate to **Add row** section

1. Scroll down and navigate to the **data** section
2. Then find **Add row** and click it to open the section
  - Also take note this is using a **POST** command.
3. Click **Try it out** just like we did previously

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124664268-2fd79a00-de79-11eb-8902-1d6636e986fb.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 4b:** FIll in values and add a row

1. Add your Astra token
2. Add the keyspaceName `todos`
3. Add the tableName `restfromreadme_by_id`. Note, this is the table we created in the earlier step

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist/blob/main/images/4b3_insert-row.png?raw=true)

4. Copy the following JSON into the **body**

```json
{"id":"57dbd260-d905-11eb-b985-c522859819b9","completed":false,"text":"TODO FROM README","key":"none"}
```

5. Click **Execute**. You should see code **201** in the response telling you it was a success and displaying the id of the row you just created.


[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 5. Retrieving values
Finally, now that we created a table and inserted a row of data let's **GET** the data back out.

‚úÖ  **Step 5a:** Navigate to **Retrieve all rows** section

1. Scroll up within the **data** section
2. Then find **Retrieve all rows** and click it to open the section
  - Take note this is using a **GET** command.
3. Click **Try it out** just like we did previously

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124666300-d6bd3580-de7b-11eb-8bf6-aeeb0487962b.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 5b:** Execute the command to display the data

1. Enter your **Astra token _(X-Cassandra-Token)_**
2. Enter the **keyspaceName** `todos`
3. Enter the **tableName** `restfromreadme_by_id`

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist/blob/main/images/5b3_retrieve-rows.png?raw=true)

4. Click **Execute**
5. View the end result data that should be exactly what we created in the previous step

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/124666847-9d38fa00-de7c-11eb-8673-84f421ff9282.png?raw=true)

## 6. Launch GitPod IDE

```diff
- Need a refresher on react basics?  Check out our [React tutorial](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/react-basics). When you're done, just click on the "Back to Main" breadcrumb to come back here.
```

- Click the button to launch the GitPod IDE.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist/)

## 7. Launch the TODO app

‚úÖ  **Step 7a:** Retrieve application token to securely connect to the database

Use the token you previously generated. If you no longer have the token and did not download a .csv, you can generate a new token using [the instructions above](#2-create-a-security-token)

‚úÖ  **Step 7b:** Configure Environment Variables and Install Dependencies

1. Create `.env` file

In the repository directory run the following command  to set up your Astra environment.  Note that this does require Node 15 and NPM 7 to work.  You can install a node version manager like `nvm` or `n` to use multiple versions on your system.
```bash
npm exec astra-setup todos_workshop_db todos
```

2. üë©‚Äçüíª  Install all the packages

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

‚úÖ  **Step 7c:** Launch your app
  * Run the application 
  ```
  netlify dev
  ```
  * The application should automatically launch in the GitPod preview pane
